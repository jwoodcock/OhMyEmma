OhMyEmma
========

OhMyEmma is a PHP library for interfacing with the Emma, www.myemma.com, API and
requires an active API account_id, public_api_key, and private_api_key.

This library is based off the API documentation published on March 05, 2013 and
can be found at this URL: http://api.myemma.com/index.html. Currently Emma does
not have a method to inform users when the API is updated so this library will
only be updated when users find a need or inform the authors of a change. 

Additionally, to properly use this library it is best to read and understand
the documentation for how filters, arrays and other parameters should be 
structured as this library is not intended to validate the data structures 
provided to it. 

With that, we give you OhMyEmma

## Installing ##

You have two options for using this library, clone this repo then move it to your 
desired location and second USE COMPOSER. So, USE COMPOSER. ;-)

<pre>
    <code>
        {
            "require": {
                "kite/ohmyemma": "1.*"
            }
        }
    </code>
</pre>

## Usage ##

### Create an Instance ###

Create a new instance by providing account credentials.
<pre>
    <code>
        $emma = new Emma(
            $account_id,
            $public_api_key,
            $private_api_key
        );
    </code>
</pre>

Available interfaces are: (case sensitive)
* Fields
* Groups
* Mailings
* Members
* Response
* Searches
* Triggers
* Webhooks

Each interface has their unique set of methods. It's best to at least read 
through those files. These interfaces are saved as an object within
the main OhMyEmma object. 

### Usage of the Control Object ###

Here is an example of using the members interface to add a new member and then 
retreave an updated list of members. 

<pre>
    <code>
        $emma = new Emma(
            $account_id,
            $public_api_key,
            $private_api_key,
        );

        $newUser = array(
            'email' => 'notso@fast.com',
            'fields' => array(
                'first_name' => 'Jacques',
                'last_name' => 'Woodcock'
            )
        );

        $emma->Members->addUpdateMember($newUser);
        $memberList = $emma->Members->getMembers();

        print_r($memberList);
    </code>
</pre>
